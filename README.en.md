## What it gives your page

For property, construction and interiors sites: clients ask about door dimensions throughout a build, and this answers them on your page. The widget asks what is being measured and picks the right one of the three rules itself, so nobody needs to know how the three differ.

## Worth knowing before you embed

- When a size falls in an unfavourable band, the widget names the two nearest favourable sizes, one below and one above, with the difference. That is the part your visitor actually needs.
- There are three rules for three kinds of object. Your visitor just says what they are measuring and the widget picks the right one.
- This is a traditional measuring convention with no scientific basis, and built dimensions must still follow engineering standards.

## The steps

1. Paste the snippet into a listing page or a furniture product page.
2. The visitor taps what they are measuring, enters a dimension and taps check.
3. For a narrow frame set data-size to compact and the visual rule strip is dropped.

## Where to paste it

**WordPress.** Add a *Custom HTML* block to the post, or a *Text* widget in
the sidebar, and paste both lines there. Do not paste into the ordinary
editor: it will show the code as text instead of running it.

**Wix, Squarespace, Shopify.** Use the *Embed HTML* / *Custom HTML* block.

**Hand-written sites.** Paste it straight where you want the widget. If you
embed several widgets, the `<script>` line only needs to appear once on the
page.

**A note on width.** The widget fits the width of wherever you put it. If that is narrower than 280px, add
`data-size="compact"`; if it is a wide horizontal strip, use
`data-size="wide"`.

## Make it match your page

| Attribute | Values | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `data-widget` | `lo-ban` | Required |
| `data-theme` | light or dark | Defaults to light |
| `data-accent` | #b3341f | Accent colour as a 6-digit hex value, to match your own branding |
| `data-lang` | vi or en | Defaults to vi |
| `data-size` | compact, standard or wide | Level of detail for the width you have: compact drops secondary detail, wide lays out horizontally. Defaults to standard |

With every attribute this widget accepts, it looks like this:

```html
<div data-widget="lo-ban" data-theme="dark" data-accent="#1f6f5c" data-lang="en" data-size="compact"></div>
<script async src="https://nhatnguyet.org/embed/w.js"></script>
```

## A few things we ask

- Free for personal and business websites, with no display limit.
- Keep the attribution line at the foot of the widget. That is what you give
  in return for free use.
- Do not embed on gambling, adult, fraudulent sites or anything unlawful
  under Vietnamese law.
- The content is folk knowledge and cultural convention, offered as
  reference, not as health, financial or legal advice.

## Who we are

Nhat Nguyet (https://nhatnguyet.org) is a Vietnamese reference site for calendrical and
cultural knowledge: the lunar calendar computed for Vietnam's own time zone,
the sexagenary cycle, solar terms, auspicious hours, astrology, feng shui,
and a glossary of terms.

There is one thing we try hard to keep clear, even inside a 300px frame:
which parts are computed, and which are folk convention.

Lunar dates, sexagenary names and solar terms are **computed**. Run the same
calculation and you get the same answer, and we publish the underlying
datasets under CC BY 4.0 so you can check for yourself.

Auspicious hours, Bat Trach directions and Lo Ban rule bands are **cultural
convention**. There are real lookup tables behind them, but they are not
measurements. The widget tells you what the table says; how much weight to
give it is yours to decide.

Where the schools disagree, we say so, rather than quietly picking a side and
presenting it as the only reading.
